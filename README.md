# Scripts for telematics projects

#### ETL Script for Connected Car Testing blog
The script [probeVehicle.py](https://github.com/omveda/telematics/blob/master/probeVehicle.py) shows how to read/transform the connected car field testing dataset that is available from the [US Department of Transportation (USDOT)](https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Advanced-Messaging-Concept-Development-Probe-Vehic/7ee5-ppkq) website, and ingest it into a database table on OmniSci. For detailed explanation and to find reference links to the USDOT sites please refer to the blog - [Improving Connected Car Testing with Vehicle Telematics Analysis](https://www.omnisci.com/blog/).
